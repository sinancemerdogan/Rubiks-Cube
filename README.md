## Welcome

Welcome to the Rubik's Cube Simulator! This project allows you to interact with a 3D representation of a Rubik's Cube and manipulate it just like you would in real life. Whether you're a Rubik's Cube enthusiast or simply looking for a fun 3D modeling and interaction project, this simulator is for you.

## Project Overview

The Rubik's Cube consists of 8 sub-cubes arranged to form a larger 3x3x3 cube. Each sub-cube has sides colored with red, green, blue, orange, yellow, and white. The goal is to scramble the cube and then solve it by making a series of 90-degree rotations.

## Features

- **3D Visualization**: A visually appealing 3D representation of the Rubik's Cube with realistic colors and shading.

- **Random Initialization**: The cube can be initialized in a random configuration with optional animated effects.

- **User Interaction**: You can interact with the cube in various ways:
  - Rotate the entire cube to view it from different angles.
  - Select and rotate individual faces to make moves.

- **Picking Mechanism**: Implemented picking mechanism to select which face to rotate for a move.

- **Customizable Options**: You can customize the simulation as per your preferences, such as enabling edge display, continuous rotation animations, and more.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project using your preferred development environment.
3. Run the application.
4. Explore, scramble, and solve the Rubik's Cube!

## User Interface

We have designed an intuitive user interface that allows you to interact with the cube effortlessly. You can easily rotate the cube, select faces to make moves, and enjoy a smooth and responsive experience.

## Notes

- This project is primarily focused on 3D modeling and interaction. It does not include solving algorithms, but you can integrate them if you wish.

- The project uses orthographic viewing for simplicity, and the viewing procedures in the sample programs should be sufficient for most users.
